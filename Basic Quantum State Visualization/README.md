## Quantum Circuit Bloch Sphere Visualization

## Overview:-

This project creates a simple quantum circuit with one qubit, applies a Hadamard gate to create a superposition state, and visualizes the resulting quantum state on a Bloch sphere. The visualization is saved as a PNG image.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
