## Bell State Entanglement Visualizer

This project simulates a quantum circuit to create and visualize a Bell state using Qiskit. The circuit applies a Hadamard gate and a CNOT gate to entangle two qubits, then visualizes the entanglement via a statevector city plot and measurement outcomes via a histogram.

## Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or higher
A virtual environment (recommended)
A graphical environment for interactive plotting (optional; visualizations are saved as PNG files)
