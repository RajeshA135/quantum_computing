## Bell Circuit Simulation with Qiskit
This project simulates a quantum circuit that creates a Bell state Using Qiskit.
## The circuit:
    Applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit.

    Applies a CNOT gate to entangle the first qubit with the second.

    Measures both qubits.

    Displays a histogram of the measurement outcomes to verify entanglement.

## Prerequisites
Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.8 or higher
A virtual environment (recommended for isolated development)
