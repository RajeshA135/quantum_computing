# Quantum Coin Toss Simulation 

This project simulates a fair coin toss using quantum computing principles. A Hadamard gate is applied to a qubit, resulting in a 50% chance of measuring |0⟩ (Heads) or |1⟩ (Tails).

## Prerequisites:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher
Virtual Environment: Recommended for dependency isolation
Dependencies: Listed in requirements.txt

## Requirements
- Python
- Qiskit
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
