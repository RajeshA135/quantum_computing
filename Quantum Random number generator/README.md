## Quantum Random Number Generator

## Overview:

This project implements a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) using Qiskit, a quantum computing framework by IBM. It generates an 8-bit random number by placing qubits in superposition using Hadamard gates, measuring them, and converting the resulting bitstring to a decimal number. The output is visualized as a bar plot using Matplotlib, showing the random number and its binary representation.

## Prerequisites:

Python: Version 3.8 or higher
Virtual Environment: Recommended for dependency isolation

## Requirements:
qiskit: For quantum circuit creation.
qiskit-aer: For simulation backend.
matplotlib: For plotting the result.
